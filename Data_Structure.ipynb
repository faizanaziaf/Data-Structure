        "**A1:** Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently; they are crucial for optimizing data access, manipulation, and processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2:** Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.  \n",
        "**A2:** Mutable data types (e.g., lists) can be changed after creation, while immutable types (e.g., tuples) cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3:** What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?  \n",
        "**A3:** Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable; lists use more memory but are more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4:** Describe how dictionaries store data.  \n",
        "**A4:** Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a hash map for fast lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5:** Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?  \n",
        "**A5:** Sets are useful for eliminating duplicates and performing fast membership checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q6:** What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?  \n",
        "**A6:** A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is mutable and can hold various data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q7:** How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?  \n",
        "**A7:** Tuples are immutable, preventing accidental changes and ensuring consistency.\n",

        "**Q8:** What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?  \n",
        "**A8:** A hash table is a data structure for fast lookups; dictionaries in Python use hash tables to store key-value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9:** Can lists contain different data types in Python?  \n",
        "**A9:** Yes, lists can contain elements of different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q10:** Explain why strings are immutable in Python.  \n",
        "**A10:** Strings are immutable to ensure security, data integrity, and efficiency in memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q11:** What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?  \n",
        "**A11:** Dictionaries offer faster lookups by keys and are ideal for associative data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12:** Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.  \n",
        "**A12:** Use a tuple when data should not change, like representing fixed coordinates or settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q13:** How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?  \n",
        "**A13:** Sets automatically remove duplicate values, ensuring all elements are unique.\n",

        "**Q14:** How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?  \n",
        "**A14:** For lists, `in` checks for values; for dictionaries, it checks for keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q15:** Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.  \n",
        "**A15:** No, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q16:** What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.  \n",
        "**A16:** A nested dictionary has dictionaries within dictionaries, e.g., storing student info with subjects as keys.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q19:** Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?  \n",
        "**A19:** Dictionaries are unordered because they store data based on keys, not positions; retrieval relies on keys, not order.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q20:** Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.  \n",
        "**A20:** Lists retrieve data by index, while dictionaries retrieve data by keys."
